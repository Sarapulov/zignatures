    "long_description": "**Zignatures** is a powerful Zendesk Support app that lives in the ticket sidebar—both for new and existing tickets—and automatically injects a custom signature when a ticket is submitted.\n\n### Overview\n\nWith **Zignatures**, Admins can easily create intelligent, branded signatures with a fully customized look and feel. Signatures can be simple text, enhanced with Zendesk-supported HTML, or completely tailored using Zendesk Dynamic Content and Liquid Syntax. This flexibility allows you to insert virtually any HTML code, including advanced IF-ELSE conditions, to adapt signatures dynamically.\n\n**Zignatures** also empowers Zendesk Support Agents by giving them visibility and control over how signatures behave. When enabled, agents can view the app and choose whether to apply or toggle a signature depending on the context of each ticket.\n\n### Look & Feel\n\n![](https://cl.ly/2R1n0T2H2o35/Image%202018-07-12%20at%201.26.37%20PM.png)\n\n![](https://cl.ly/3e3O3p0M1L3F/Screen%20Recording%202018-07-12%20at%2001.33%20PM.gif)\n\n### Popular use cases include:\n\n- Dynamic signatures that pull data from tickets or users (e.g., displaying the ticket group name in the signature)\n- Multi-brand support, with different signatures for each brand\n- Conditional exclusions, such as omitting signatures for SMS, internal notes, or other specific channels (e.g., skip signatures in SMS replies)\n- Advanced branding needs, including custom colors, fonts, layouts, and more\n\nYour Marketing and Branding teams can get creative, using Zignatures’ customization capabilities to promote products, highlight services, or simply spread positive vibes through every interaction.\n\n### Privacy & Data Use:\n\nZignatures runs entirely within the Zendesk Application Framework and does not transmit, store, or share any data outside of your Zendesk instance. No customer or ticket data is accessed beyond what is required to generate signatures, and no data is sent to external servers. The app has also passed additional security and privacy verifications for multiple customers.",
